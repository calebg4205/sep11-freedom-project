# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Caleb Garcia**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **React** in order to help me make **Immigration website**. The Wesbite translates based on the users position and has a manual translation feature. The website is build with **Express.js** also which my partner [Jacob Levit](https://github.com/jacobl3371) studied.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Helps immigrants who are knew to the country navigate the complex US legal system in thier own language. Built to be accessible and work for people from all over no matter what language you speak or where you come from.
##### CONS
* If you are using a VPN our website will translate into the country your VPN is in. This can make it difficult for VPN users but we include a manual translation button. This button is large enough to infer what it means.
