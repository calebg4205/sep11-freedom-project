# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Express.js**

## Project: **Translator for Immigrants**

---

### 10/18/24:
* I started the download for express.js
* It was hard because I didn't know a lot about downloading frameworks
* You can get express [here](https://expressjs.com/)
* Me and Jacob had to problem solve becasue we can't download Node in browser IDE
* This led me to get [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
* Once I set everything up I watched a youtube video on [Vscode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORrELERGIHs)

### 10/20/24:

* I started working with express.js
* I learned how to send a string:
``` javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello World")

})
```
* I was having trouble previewing my code so I asked my friend Shi-Jun:

* We hopped on Voice call together and he helped me set it up:

* Once I finished learning some of the basics from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SccSCuHhOw0&t=134s)
### Next time
* Next week I will finish the YouTube video and begin working on my own project
* I hope to begin working on the translator soon
* I also hope to explore Next.js and react to see how they can help
