# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Express.js**

## Project: **Translator for Immigrants**

---

### 10/18/24:
* I started the download for express.js
* It was hard because I didn't know a lot about downloading frameworks
* You can get express [here](https://expressjs.com/)
* Me and Jacob had to problem solve becasue we can't download Node in browser IDE
* This led me to get [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
* Once I set everything up I watched a youtube video on [Vscode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORrELERGIHs)

### 10/20/24:

* I started working with express.js
* I learned how to send a string:
``` javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello World")

})
```
* I was having trouble previewing my code so I asked my friend Shi-Jun:

* We hopped on Voice call together and he helped me set it up:

* Once I finished learning some of the basics from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SccSCuHhOw0&t=134s)
### Next time
* Next week I will finish the YouTube video and begin working on my own project
* I hope to begin working on the translator soon
* I also hope to explore Next.js and react to see how they can help

### 10/23
* Watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY6icfhap2o) on middle wear and took notes
* In Express.js, middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
* I also finished [The basics YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SccSCuHhOw0&t=134s) and began building on my own
### 11/3
* I began learning node commands from [The Node website](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html)
* The most important one was `node app.js` (app.js is just the name). This command is used to run the code to the port that you choose here:
```js
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

```
* I want to start my own project but I don't have time. I am following this roadmap:

* My next step is ES6 models with arrow notation

##### Problems I encountered
* I just figured out how to run my code in Github CodeSpaces, so that should work better now
    * I have to change the port each time which is annoying
* Figuring out how to code my own project is hard when I don't know that much about conditionals and loops so I will work on that
* ES6 arrow notation is a lot like Greater than and less than signs which is confusing me.

### Nest steps:
* Watch a video to get ahead on JavaScript
* Begin working on API development
* Work on Frontend of our website with Jacob
