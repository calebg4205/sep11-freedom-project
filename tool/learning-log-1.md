### 10/18/24:
* I started the download for express.js
* It was hard because I didn't know a lot about downloading frameworks
* You can get express [here](https://expressjs.com/)
* Me and Jacob had to problem solve becasue we can't download Node in browser IDE
* This led me to get [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
* Once I set everything up I watched a youtube video on [Vscode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORrELERGIHs)
